# Student-Portal

The Student Portal was one of the school group projects that I worked with. It was one of the requirements in my program (subject). This was aimed at helping students interact or stay in touch with the university's activities in their comfort zone.


## Features
- Login and Account Registration
- Professors and administrators can make announcements.
- The Professor can provide downloadable materials.
- Students can view their grades and schedules.
- Students evaluate their instructor


**Note:** *Some of the features are not implemented well because of the lack of development time.*
